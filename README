rip44d

This is a custom RIPv2 daemon which is only useful if you're participating
in the amateur radio 44/8 Amprnet gateways tunnel network. It updates
ipip tunnel mesh routes based on RIP updates coming from a master server.
rip44d does not even transmit RIP packets by itself.

More information can be found in the ampr-gateways wiki:
